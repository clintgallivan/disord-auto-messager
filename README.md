# disord-bot

### What is this?

For many crypto startups, there are community social media channels, and discord is a very common place for community members to hang out and discuss relevant topics.

For many of these projects, you are able to get a "whitelist" allocation if you build a high enough score on discord, and are an active contributing community member. 

I built this bot to make it easy to collect whitelist slots, and gave it to my friends too :)

React Native, Expo for Web, Typescript
