### What is this, and why would i use it?

For many cryptocurrency based, blockchain startups, there are community social media channels, and discord is a very common place for community members to hang out and discuss relevant topics.

When many of these projects begin building their communities, if you as a new community member contribute and stay active enough, you have a decent possibility of obtaining a "whitelist" allocation investment opportunity.

When a project holds a "TGE - Token Gathering Event", they will essentially "IPO"... or in crypto terms, "IDO/ICO". They will launch the token for sale at a specified price.

As a "whitelisted" community member, you may have the chance to buy a token at a significantly discounted price - kind of like a stock option, but with a generally shorter excercise window.

I built this bot for myself and my friends, to make it easy to be an "active" community member in various communities, and gather whitelist slots along the way :)
